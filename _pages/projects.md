**Guided Diffusion based Generative model**

* A study project to design a Guided Diffusion Model that generates adversarial scenarios to predict violations in an autonomous driving system
* Synthesized a dataset using Carla with benchmark architectures like: Transfuser, Interfuser, Transfuser++, LMDrive for safe and adversarial scenarios
* Trained the designed Diffusion Model architecture, to create new adverserial scenarios and validate over the existing models

**Deep Neural Network**

* A foundational ML project to develop a deep neural network model to identify and track a target in simulation
* Trained multiple model architectures from scratch and analyzed the comparative performance on the image dataset
* More details of the project: [Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/rastri-dey/Deep_Neural_Network)
