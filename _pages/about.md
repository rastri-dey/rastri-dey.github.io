I’m a technical lead specializing in autonomous driving systems with interests in deep learning, perception systems and motion planning. I’ve 8 years of industry experience for working closely with leading automotive clients. During this time, I’ve also gained research experience while working on multiple patents and publications, leveling myself up for the production grade solutions. Previously, I’ve graduated in Robotics from [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://robotics.umich.edu ). I’ve worked towards:

* Studying the Diffusion based generative models setup on the benchmark Transformer architectures (Transfuser++, Interfuser) and Vision-language models (LMDrive, CarLLaVA) to utilize them for generating adversarial scenarios to predict violations
* Development for Perception Systems including Object data clustering, Classification and Target tracking under Lidar, Radar and Event camera system with deterministic and ML components
* Deployment of safe controllers for building safety critical features like Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) systems

You can also find my work on [my google scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=list_works&authuser=1&gmla=AH8HC4y2KnaKupt03UHSWn5MHA7bHc5oJ3QtfMJZvjEy69TumJbo9ucypkms50RXizVSZfnX_fAUG2v_daITVQ&user=fe3QMp8AAAAJ). In parallel, I've been building a beginner-friendly research repository for [Language Model from scratch](https://github.com/rastri-dey/Ground-up-implementations-ML-algorithms-),to create foundations for a more evolved project. 

I also enjoy collective brainstorming sessions, hit me up if you have any project idea and want to collaborate!!
